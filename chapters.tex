\chapter{Dialogue systems}\label{dialogue systems}
Dialogue system is a computer system to communicate with a human. Nowadays you meet dialog systems everywhere. A lot of devices have incorporated goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems, such as  Yandex’s Alisa,  Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. Dialogue systems are also used in cars (hands-free car-specific functions, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, vendor-specific solutions), web (search assistants (IKEA), Facebook Messenger and Telegram chatbots), robots, computer games, research systems (skylar.speech.cs.cmu.edu) etc, because a conversation is a natural way for people to get information.

\textbf{Basic Dialogue System Types}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Task-oriented 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item focused on completing a certain task(s)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Non-task-oriented
		\begin{itemize}
			\item chitchat
			\item gaming the Turing test
		\end{itemize}		
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Communication Domains}:

"\textbf{Domain}" is a conversation topic or an area of interest
\begin{itemize}
	\item Single/Closed-domain is one well-defined area
	\item Multi-domain is joining several single-domain systems
	\item Open-domain “responds to anything”
\end{itemize}


Exists several \textbf{modes of communication}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Text
	\item Voice
	\item Multimodal
		\begin{itemize}
			\item voice/text + graphics
			\item additional modalities: video - gestures, mimics; touch
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dialogue initiative}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item system-initiative
		\begin{itemize}
			\item system asks questions, user must reply in oreder to progress
			\item least natural
			\item "form-filling" ("Hello, please enter your e-mail") 
		\end{itemize}
	\item user-initiative
		\begin{itemize}
			\item user asks, machine responds ("Siri, set the timer for 5 minutes")
		\end{itemize}
	\item mixed-initiative
		\begin{itemize}
			\item system and user both can ask and react to queries
			\item most natural
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dialogue system architecture} is illustrated in Figure \ref{ds architecture}. This architecture consists from Natural Language Understanding (NLU), dialogue management (DM), and Natural Language Generation (NLG).

\textbf{NLU} extracts the meaning from the user utterance and converts into a structured semantic representation. Natural Language Understanding traditionally consists of domain identification and intent prediction, which are framed as utterance classification problems, and slot filling, framed as a sequence tagging task.

\textbf{DM} plays two roles,tracking the dialogue state and performing the dialogue policy (i.e., telling the agent how to act given the dialogue state.)

\textbf{NLG} transforms structured data into natural language.\cite{open_domain_neural_ds}

\chapter{Natural Language Generation}\label{nlg}
Natural Language Generation is a subsection of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
NLG approaches can be grouped into two categories, one focuses on generating text using templates or rules (linguistic) methods, the other uses corpus-based statistical methods. Oh and Rudnicky showed that stochastic generation benefits from two factors: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item it takes advantage of the practical language of a domain expert instead of the developer
	\item it restates the problem in terms of classification and labeling, where expertise is not required for developing a rule-based generation system
\end{itemize}

There are a variety of methods to generate responses for nontask-oriented systems, such as machine translation
(Ritter et al., 2011), retrieval-based response selection (Banchs and Li, 2012), and sequence-tosequence recurrent neural network (Vinyals and
Le, 2015). However, these systems still produce utterances that are incoherent or inappropriate from time to time.

4 Social Chat Bots
Social bots are of growing importance in facilitating smooth interaction between humans and
their electronic devices. Recently, researcher have
begun to explore data-driven generation of conversational responses within the framework of
nerual machine translation (NMT) in the form
of encoder-decoder or seq2seq models (Sordoni
et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al.,
2016a), as illustrated in Figure 2.
However, the generated responses are often too
general to carry meaningful information, such as
“I don’t know.”, which can serve as a response to
any user questions. A mutual information based
model was proposed to address the issue, a mutual information model is proposed by Li et al.
(2016a), and is later improved by using deep reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2016c). Furthermore, Li et al. (2016b) presented a persona-based
model to address the issue of speaker consistency
in neural response generation.
Although task-oriented dialogue systems and
social bots are originally developed for different
purposes, there is a trend of combining both as
a step towards building an open-domain dialogue
agent.
For example, on the one hand, Ghazvininejad
et al. (2017) presented a fully data-driven and
knowledge-grounded neural conversation model
aimed at producing more contentful responses
without slot filling. On the other hand, Zhao et al.
(2017) proposed a task-oriented dialogue agented
based on the encoder-decoder model with chatting
capability.
